Prerequisite:
- 7-zip installed

How To Mod Dead Island:
1.) open the archive of data0.pak
2.) go to skills folder and you can mess around with the values in all the xml files (not sure how to mod the scr and phx files)
3.) default_skills.xml has most of your player values like run speed, attack speed, weapon dmg, and so on
4.) once you are done with your changes you can just save and update the archive and see the changes in game

Notes: 
1.) All you need is regular old notepad for these kind of changes
2.) do not put speed at 15 or above there is a collision threshold that makes you take dmg from running too fast
