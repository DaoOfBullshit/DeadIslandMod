Prerequisite:
1.) 7-zip and Winrar installed

Install Guide:

Setup:
1.) Make a folder anywhere on your pc (I prefer using a hard drive for this stuff)
2.) Now go to your Dead Island game directory (Rick click Dead Island in steam library, go to manage, then browse local files)
   2a.) Open the DI folder and you should see a Data0.pak, copy it 
   2b.) Go back to the folder you made earlier (not the game directory)
3.) Make 2 more folders inside with 1 titled vanilla backup and the other as temp 
4.) Copy the Data0.pak into both folders
5.) go into the temp folder and extract the pak (right click --> 7-zip --> extract here)

Changing the Files:
1.) Download the github repository into the temp folder and extract it there using either winrar or 7-zip
2.) Replace the files in the unzipped folder
   2a.) Copy all of the xml files (NOT the mp4 or txt files)
   2b.) Go to data0 --> skills --> paste and replace
3.) compressing the folder back into a pak for use
   3a.) Right click on the data0 folder --> add to archive --> change archive name to data0.pak --> archive format on zip
	 --> compression level on 0 - store --> update mode on add and replace files --> click ok (if it asks to replace pak say yes)
4.) Copy and paste the new pak to the game directory and replace the old pak
5.) Now you should have a vanilla backup in case something went wrong or you simply want to go back to vanilla, enjoy :)
